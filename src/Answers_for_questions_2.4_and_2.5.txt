2.4). What if we want to record course scores?  What possible changes need to be made? Explain briefly.

Answer) REGISTRATION table will have another column - SCORE that will store the score of a course for a student.

         Changes in Student Entity class:
         1) Set<Course> course will be replaced by Set<Registration> registration.
         2) Set<Registration> registration will have @OneToMany

         Changes in Student Entity class:
         1) Set<Student> student will be replaced by Set<Registration> registration.
         2) Set<Registration> registration will have @OneToMany

         New Entity class - Registration:

         @Entity
         @Table(name = "REGISTRATION")
         class Registration {
             @Id
             @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
             Long id;

             @ManyToOne
             @JoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID")
             Student student;

             @ManyToOne
             @JoinColumn(name = "COURSE_ID")
             Course course;

             Integer score;
         }
